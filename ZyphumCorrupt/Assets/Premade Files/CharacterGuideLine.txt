//This is a guideline on how to write a file for a character prefab or save file
//Each stat or object tied to a character will be on a new line and start with the stat name ie Name MHP CHP STR and so on
//The files for generating characters from the gacha will not have CHP 
//HP will be the only stat not based out of 1 - 100. HP will be capped at 99,999. Mana will be tied to MAG and will be multipled by 10. So if the character has
//50 MAG they will have 500 Mana at max level. We will have to determine a way to implement this so the lower level chaacters are restricted on mana. Maybe a 
//modifer system based on level?
